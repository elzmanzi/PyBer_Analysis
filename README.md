# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
On top of this we will create a summary for the cities showing total total amount of fares, total drivers, total rides
average fare per ride, average fare per drive for each city type.

## Results:

![Totals by City type]()

- comparing the totals, Urban has the lowest average fair per ride and per driver but it has highest total fares comparing to the rest. 
Urban city type has also the highest number of drivers, 
- Ride-sharing in urban cities is expensive comparing to rural areas and suburban.

## Summary:
Urban cities has many numbers of drivers, this might be because Urban cities are always dense populated comparing to the rest of the areas. 
- As the population increases the number of demand of drivers increases and will lead to the increase of total rides.


## Pyber plan
During the Pyber analysis we have completed and followed the below plan.

Import your data into a Pandas DataFrame.

Merge your DataFrames.

Create a bubble chart that showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural.

Determine the mean, median, and mode for the following:

	-The total number of rides for each city type.
	- The average fares for each city type.
	- The total number of drivers for each city type.
- Create box-and-whisker plots that visualize each of the following to determine if there are any outliers:

	- The number of rides for each city type.
	- The fares for each city type.
	- The number of drivers for each city type.

- Create a pie chart that visualizes each of the following data for each city type:

	- The percent of total fares.

	- The percent of total rides.
